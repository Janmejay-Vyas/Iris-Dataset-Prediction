# Iris-Dataset-Prediction

This project uses machine learning algorithm on the publically available iris dataset to created a trained model for predicting the type of species from a given input. The trained model is already included in the repository and is called in the program using the `pickel` module. 

The accuracy of the model is **96.33%**
